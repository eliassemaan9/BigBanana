This project is to sync data from a local database to an online.
In the local database I was added statusId in orders table when you add new order by default take 1 when you sync the data become 0 .
it's help to don't sync the data many times.
if you have any question please let me know.


NOTE:The project created with php + mysql.
I was created a slim php project v4 but I don't have time to learn how to create an api with it.
I will send you the slim project by email.
